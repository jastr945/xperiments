      "title": "A Coastal Weekend Away from it All in Cannon Beach",
      "body": "Sometimes as a family we don’t need a full-on holiday, we need a quick weekend fix. We need a place where we can pack for a night or two away and come back feeling refreshed and ready for the week ahead without a daunting pile of laundry or a giant time adjustment. We need to feel the sand under our feet and get campfire in our hair, but we don’t want to bring the tent and camping gear. And if we can bring our four-legged friends along, we can’t ask for much more.Year-Round Cannon Beach Cannon Beach, Oregon is a comfortable driving distance from Portland, Seattle, and Tacoma and even Vancouver BC (yes, it’s a stretch, but my family did this on a few memorable vacations growing up). It is an adorable town on the coast unobstructed by islands so the waves crash from all the way across the Pacific onto the shore and the sand is the perfect type for building sand castles. In fact, people come from all over to see the Sand Castle contest in June and it’s one of the oldest sandcastle contests in the United States. And even though summer is the most popular time for people to visit, there are year-round activities in the area (and storm-watching season can be fun with wee ones in tow too!). Where to Stay in Cannon Beach The Surfsand Resort is beachfront with comfortable amenities and warm welcomes for kids and dogs. The resort offers many free amenities, like bike rentals and parking, and there are cookies and milk in the lobby every afternoon. Many rooms overlook the famous Haystack Rock and there are multiple room option types from traditional hotel rooms to two-bedroom suites. Kids will love roasting marshmallows around a bonfire on the beach at night (weather-permitting) and the heated pool makes this a perfectly family-friendly place to stay. There are also many other hotels and Airbnbs in the area too. There is a campsite near the beach called Wright’s for Camping that we would love to hear if any of our Trekaroo families have been to too!Where to eat in Cannon Beach There are so many kid-friendly eateries in Cannon Beach. The Public Coast Brewery recently opened in May and has some great kid’s meal options and a dog-friendly patio. (If you are staying at the Surfsand Resort, check to see if they have a kids-eat-free promotion going on when you visit). The Cannon Beach Hardware and Public House is exactly this-a pub inside a hardware store and there is a good selection of kids’ toys and beach paraphernalia in this place too! For coffee lovers, the Sleepy Monk and Insomnia Coffee are fantastic for picking up a latte and both have tasty house-made pastries for quick breakfasts and snacks. If you want to order a picnic, the Cannon Beach Cafe will pack one for you so you can enjoy it on the beach. The Pig N Pancake is also a fun, Oregon Coast based chain with breakfast served anytime.Family-Friendly Activities in the Cannon Beach Area If the sun is out, there is no reason not to be on the sand. Many families love exploring the tidepools, flying kites, and building sandcastles. From April to June you can can search for the adorable puffins who nest on the top of Haystack Rock. Family Funcycles is a great place to rent sand bicycles that are speedy and fun to ride on the hard-packed sand (and there are trailers for kids who are too little to ride on their own). The shop also sells comic books and sports cards and is right next to a convenience store if you need to pick up snacks and treats for your adventure. If you want to venture a little farther north up the coast, another scenic place to explore is Ecola State Park. In town, Bruce’s Candy Kitchen has been around for over 50 years and is full of unique candies and sugary treats.  And if you go near Gepetto’s Toy store with your kids, you’ll probably be there a while. What to pack Because weather can be unpredictable on the coast, make sure to be prepared for ALL weather. Rain jackets and waterproof pants, rubber boots, beach towels, and flip flops might all be used on the same trip. You might also want to bring plastic bags for sandy shoes, a kite for a windy day, and have The Goonies pre-downloaded to watch if the weather gets a little too stormy. And maybe paczk that book you’ve been wanting to read, because you may even get a chance to read it.",

      "title": "Going to Cannon Beach",
      "body": "If you’re going to Cannon Beach, Seattle Times readers can steer you to their favorite places to eat in the northern Oregon beach town. I recently wrote about oceanfront places for winter storm-watching in the Pacific Northwest and B.C.,  including Cannon Beach. When I was there I mostly cocooned in my cozy lodgings in the evenings, cooking in the kitchenette after long days of walking the broad sandy beach and nearby trails of Ecola State Park.  So I asked readers for their recommendations on where to eat in Cannon Beach. Some excerpts: “Mo’s is great and right on the beach. If you’re looking for a more formal dining experience, I recommend Newmans at 988. Right off Hemlock, the restaurant is in a cute little old house, and within walking distance from multiple inns and hotels, and shops. For breakfast/brunch, the Pig n’ Pancake is great as well. There are locations in Seaside, Portland and other cities on the coast. Classic diner food, friendly service, good for groups and kids too.” (Submitted by Kwan.) “… For breakfast there is none better than Lazy Susan and for dinner The Irish Table offers excellent food and friendly, knowledgeable service. You really are shortchanging yourself if you don’t eat at these two establishments at least once during any visit to Cannon Beach. (Submitted by Dansk.) “We travel to or through Cannon Beach at least four times a year, preferably in the offseason. We always have dinner at Sweet Basil’s Cafe on North Hemlock.  The food is excellent, the menu original, the wine selections very nice and the service solid.  They often have good live entertainment. It’s best to check on their hours if you’re there offseason before planning to eat there. ” (Submitted by Pine Buffalo.) “The Cannon Beach Hardware Store and Public House, also known as the “Screw and Brew”, is a great lunch or light dinner spot in midtown. Delicious homemade soups, sandwiches, an incredible ahi salad and an ever-changing list of microbrews mean there is something for everybody. The Sleepy Monk coffee bar is next door. Downtown, Bill’s Tavern and Brewhouse has beer brewed on-site plus good basic pub food. For the freshest fish around, try Ecola Seafoods at 2nd and Spuce. Their peppered smoked salmon is incredible.” (Submitted by user 1057912.) “There are a many very good restaurants in Cannon Beach and your visit there is lacking unless you give a couple a try. Our favorite “routine” stop is the Driftwood Inn.  For “haute” cuisine the restaurant at the Stephanie Inn provides satisfaction in that department. A new Irish-themed restaurant is doing very well.  For breakfast our fav is the Shorebird (at the Surfsand Resort) not only for the food but the amazing view of the each and The Rock.  Up in Seaside (just 6 miles away) you can truly indulge yourself with deep-fried Twinkies and other candied treats.  …” (Submitted by Space Scientist.) “Haven’t seen anyone mention Pizza a Fetta in Cannon Beach yet. Hands down some of the very best pizza I have ever had. Definitely recommend it.” (Submitted by WayAbvPar.) “Mo’s restaurant at the south end of Cannon Beach is great for clam chowder and up and close stormwatching from their restaurant windows which overlooks the south part of Cannon Beach. Bella’s is great for coffee and is tucked into the shops on Hemlock, located across from the Cannon Beach Bakery which is a great place to stop for morning pastries. …” (Submitted by msh69.)",

      "body": "The route Cannon Beach north to Astoria on U.S. 101, the Oregon Coast Highway, to the Astoria-Megler Bridge at the Oregon-Washington line.Miles About 25 miles one way, or 200 miles for a loop from Portland on U.S. 30 and 26. Best time Summer for warm days and seabirds near Cannon Beach; September for fair weather and smaller crowds; winter for wild storms. Why Oregon’s scenic coast is captured in microcosm along this northern stretch, from wide and walkable beaches, headlands and an iconic sea stack in Cannon Beach to Astoria’s charming shops and an incredible view from its namesake column, a landmark tower. Highlights Pull off 101 and take a quick tour of quaint downtown Cannon Beach before driving up winding Ecola State Park Road to the majestic headlands. The view of Haystack Rock below is breathtaking. From April to August the rock is home to nesting tufted puffins and other seabirds; low tide also creates opportunities to explore tidepools. After getting back on 101, consider a stop to grab taffy in Seaside or a bike exploration of Fort Stevens State Park near Warrenton. Also near Warrenton is Lewis and Clark National Historical Park and its replica of Ft. Clatsop, where the explorers wintered in 1805. Make time to visit the small but high-quality Columbia River Maritime Museum in Astoria, and end the day with a climb up the 164 steps of the picturesque Astoria Column. Memorable stay Two terrific possibilities here, either the ultra-comfortable oceanfront Surfsand for a beach bonfire in Cannon Beach or the chic Cannery Pier Hotel & Spa in Astoria, where you can watch majestic ships pass.Memorable meal For a special occasion, spend $149 per person (wine pairing included) on the energetic and entertaining dinner cooking demonstration at EVOO Cannon Beach. Or try amazingly fresh and modestly priced fish at Ecola Seafoods, also in Cannon Beach. Tourist trap or treat Treat all the way. It's off the beaten track, but stop in the tiny community of Gearhart for a buttery pastry and coffee at Pacific Way Bakery & Cafe, now in its 29th yummy year. Plan to spend About 1½ hours for the drive alone, but you will want to make it a full day from Portland or spend a night in Cannon Beach, Gearhart, Seaside or Astoria.",
