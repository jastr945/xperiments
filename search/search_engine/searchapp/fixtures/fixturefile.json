      "title": "A Coastal Weekend Away from it All in Cannon Beach",
      "body": "Sometimes as a family we don’t need a full-on holiday, we need a quick weekend fix. We need a place where we can pack for a night or two away and come back feeling refreshed and ready for the week ahead without a daunting pile of laundry or a giant time adjustment. We need to feel the sand under our feet and get campfire in our hair, but we don’t want to bring the tent and camping gear. And if we can bring our four-legged friends along, we can’t ask for much more.Year-Round Cannon Beach Cannon Beach, Oregon is a comfortable driving distance from Portland, Seattle, and Tacoma and even Vancouver BC (yes, it’s a stretch, but my family did this on a few memorable vacations growing up). It is an adorable town on the coast unobstructed by islands so the waves crash from all the way across the Pacific onto the shore and the sand is the perfect type for building sand castles. In fact, people come from all over to see the Sand Castle contest in June and it’s one of the oldest sandcastle contests in the United States. And even though summer is the most popular time for people to visit, there are year-round activities in the area (and storm-watching season can be fun with wee ones in tow too!). Where to Stay in Cannon Beach The Surfsand Resort is beachfront with comfortable amenities and warm welcomes for kids and dogs. The resort offers many free amenities, like bike rentals and parking, and there are cookies and milk in the lobby every afternoon. Many rooms overlook the famous Haystack Rock and there are multiple room option types from traditional hotel rooms to two-bedroom suites. Kids will love roasting marshmallows around a bonfire on the beach at night (weather-permitting) and the heated pool makes this a perfectly family-friendly place to stay. There are also many other hotels and Airbnbs in the area too. There is a campsite near the beach called Wright’s for Camping that we would love to hear if any of our Trekaroo families have been to too!Where to eat in Cannon Beach There are so many kid-friendly eateries in Cannon Beach. The Public Coast Brewery recently opened in May and has some great kid’s meal options and a dog-friendly patio. (If you are staying at the Surfsand Resort, check to see if they have a kids-eat-free promotion going on when you visit). The Cannon Beach Hardware and Public House is exactly this-a pub inside a hardware store and there is a good selection of kids’ toys and beach paraphernalia in this place too! For coffee lovers, the Sleepy Monk and Insomnia Coffee are fantastic for picking up a latte and both have tasty house-made pastries for quick breakfasts and snacks. If you want to order a picnic, the Cannon Beach Cafe will pack one for you so you can enjoy it on the beach. The Pig N Pancake is also a fun, Oregon Coast based chain with breakfast served anytime.Family-Friendly Activities in the Cannon Beach Area If the sun is out, there is no reason not to be on the sand. Many families love exploring the tidepools, flying kites, and building sandcastles. From April to June you can can search for the adorable puffins who nest on the top of Haystack Rock. Family Funcycles is a great place to rent sand bicycles that are speedy and fun to ride on the hard-packed sand (and there are trailers for kids who are too little to ride on their own). The shop also sells comic books and sports cards and is right next to a convenience store if you need to pick up snacks and treats for your adventure. If you want to venture a little farther north up the coast, another scenic place to explore is Ecola State Park. In town, Bruce’s Candy Kitchen has been around for over 50 years and is full of unique candies and sugary treats.  And if you go near Gepetto’s Toy store with your kids, you’ll probably be there a while. What to pack Because weather can be unpredictable on the coast, make sure to be prepared for ALL weather. Rain jackets and waterproof pants, rubber boots, beach towels, and flip flops might all be used on the same trip. You might also want to bring plastic bags for sandy shoes, a kite for a windy day, and have The Goonies pre-downloaded to watch if the weather gets a little too stormy. And maybe paczk that book you’ve been wanting to read, because you may even get a chance to read it.",

      "title": "Going to Cannon Beach",
      "body": "If you’re going to Cannon Beach, Seattle Times readers can steer you to their favorite places to eat in the northern Oregon beach town. I recently wrote about oceanfront places for winter storm-watching in the Pacific Northwest and B.C.,  including Cannon Beach. When I was there I mostly cocooned in my cozy lodgings in the evenings, cooking in the kitchenette after long days of walking the broad sandy beach and nearby trails of Ecola State Park.  So I asked readers for their recommendations on where to eat in Cannon Beach. Some excerpts: “Mo’s is great and right on the beach. If you’re looking for a more formal dining experience, I recommend Newmans at 988. Right off Hemlock, the restaurant is in a cute little old house, and within walking distance from multiple inns and hotels, and shops. For breakfast/brunch, the Pig n’ Pancake is great as well. There are locations in Seaside, Portland and other cities on the coast. Classic diner food, friendly service, good for groups and kids too.” (Submitted by Kwan.) “… For breakfast there is none better than Lazy Susan and for dinner The Irish Table offers excellent food and friendly, knowledgeable service. You really are shortchanging yourself if you don’t eat at these two establishments at least once during any visit to Cannon Beach. (Submitted by Dansk.) “We travel to or through Cannon Beach at least four times a year, preferably in the offseason. We always have dinner at Sweet Basil’s Cafe on North Hemlock.  The food is excellent, the menu original, the wine selections very nice and the service solid.  They often have good live entertainment. It’s best to check on their hours if you’re there offseason before planning to eat there. ” (Submitted by Pine Buffalo.) “The Cannon Beach Hardware Store and Public House, also known as the “Screw and Brew”, is a great lunch or light dinner spot in midtown. Delicious homemade soups, sandwiches, an incredible ahi salad and an ever-changing list of microbrews mean there is something for everybody. The Sleepy Monk coffee bar is next door. Downtown, Bill’s Tavern and Brewhouse has beer brewed on-site plus good basic pub food. For the freshest fish around, try Ecola Seafoods at 2nd and Spuce. Their peppered smoked salmon is incredible.” (Submitted by user 1057912.) “There are a many very good restaurants in Cannon Beach and your visit there is lacking unless you give a couple a try. Our favorite “routine” stop is the Driftwood Inn.  For “haute” cuisine the restaurant at the Stephanie Inn provides satisfaction in that department. A new Irish-themed restaurant is doing very well.  For breakfast our fav is the Shorebird (at the Surfsand Resort) not only for the food but the amazing view of the each and The Rock.  Up in Seaside (just 6 miles away) you can truly indulge yourself with deep-fried Twinkies and other candied treats.  …” (Submitted by Space Scientist.) “Haven’t seen anyone mention Pizza a Fetta in Cannon Beach yet. Hands down some of the very best pizza I have ever had. Definitely recommend it.” (Submitted by WayAbvPar.) “Mo’s restaurant at the south end of Cannon Beach is great for clam chowder and up and close stormwatching from their restaurant windows which overlooks the south part of Cannon Beach. Bella’s is great for coffee and is tucked into the shops on Hemlock, located across from the Cannon Beach Bakery which is a great place to stop for morning pastries. …” (Submitted by msh69.)",

The view of Haystack Rock below is breathtaking. From April to August the rock is home to nesting tufted puffins and other seabirds; low tide also creates opportunities to explore tidepools. After getting back on 101, consider a stop to grab taffy in Seaside or a bike exploration of Fort Stevens State Park near Warrenton. Also near Warrenton is Lewis and Clark National Historical Park and its replica of Ft. Clatsop, where the explorers wintered in 1805.

      "body": "Cannon Beach is a lovely little seashore town located on the North Coast of Oregon. To the north of us is Ecola State Park and to the south are Arcadia Beach, Hug Point, and Oswald West State Parks. Standing just offshore is Haystack Rock - possibly the most photographed chunk of basalt in the world. The scenic grandeur of our surroundings and our moderate year-round climate makes Cannon Beach a popular destination for travelers from all over the world.<hr><br>The Arts<br>The Arts Back in the '70s a small artists enclave got started here and has grown to include over twenty galleries featuring work by local, regional, and nationally known artists. Cannon Beach is a good place to find art for decoration or investment. Two galleries specialize in bronzes, one in classical fine art and bronzes, one in local wildlife, quite a few of them show the work of their owner/artists, the rest are general galleries featuring work from local and non-local artists.<hr><br>Theater<br>In keeping with our close ties with the arts Cannon Beach has a small theater, the Coaster Theater, where you can see live theatrical and musical productions. The productions I have seen have been very good amateur work. The actors are well rehearsed and directed, and the sets are low-budget but creative. That is as it should be. The immediacy of live theater - of seeing our friends and neighbors up there doing their best - is a treat that we experience too seldom in this electronic age. The Coaster Theater is located at 1st and Hemlock in Cannon Beach, Oregon. You can contact them at 503-436-1242 between 1 and 5PM daily.<hr><br>Outdoor Activities<br>The actual beach at Cannon Beach is a very nice long, clean, light-colored fine sand beach. In the surf you will see numerous rocks called sea stacks including the much photographed Haystack Rock which sits pretty much dead-center opposite the town. Beachcombing, photography, tide pooling (do it right!), beach volleyball, bird watching, whale watching, sand castle building and just plain old walking are all popular activities on our beautiful beach. A walk on the beach will clear your mind and can really change your perspective on life.<br>Cannon Beach is situated between two of the nicest state parks on the Oregon coast. Ecola State Park is just to the north of us. Ecola Park offers hiking, photography, bird watching, whale watching and picnicking. Some of the most beautiful views in the world can be seen here. The trail from the main parking lot to the Indian Beach parking lot is 1.3 miles long through coastal rainforest and is punctuated with stunning views of the shoreline.<br>A few miles to the south of Cannon Beach is Oswald West State Park. It is named for Governor Oswald West who saved our coast for the people many years ago by making it part of the state highway system. (That was not such a stretch, since the actual beach was the main north/south highway until well into the 1930s.) Cape Falcon, Short Sands Beach, and most of Neahkahnie Mountain are within this park. Hiking, photography, bird watching, whale watching, surfing, picnicking, and camping are popular activities in Oswald West State Park. The campground is a walk-in tents only area and wheelbarrows are provided to help you lug your stuff. It's a lot of fun.<hr><br>Shopping<br>Some people really like to shop, and we try to accommodate them in style. Here in Cannon Beach you will find many quality shops, but no tacky souvenir stands. Visit our links page and check out the 'Cannon Beach businesses & shopping' section to learn more about them.<hr><br>Weather<br>Just a word about weather forecasts: ignore them! It is the most frustrating thing listening to weather forecasts here - especially in the summer. Precipitation is infrequent here on the coast during July, August, and September, but it is predicted in some form almost every day. I think that if the weather forecasters can't get it right a reasonably high percentage of the time, they should quit trying. If you come in July, August or September, you should be confident that the weather will be mostly, very nice. Not hot or cold and seldom wet. We do get a lot of rain, but most comes between November and March.<br>This is the coast, so you should always be prepared with something warm and some sort of rain gear, but you probably won't have to use the rain gear much during the summer. The temperature extremes aren't....extreme, that is. Temperatures in winter tend to be in the 40s to 50s and temperatures in the summer in the 60s to low 70s. If it freezes at all in the winter, it is usually thawed by 10AM. And 80 degrees in summer is a pretty hot day. It is very easy to remain comfortable in such a narrow band. Just be prepared with a sweatshirt for that late afternoon breeze off the ocean and bring that raincoat - just in case.<br>If you click here you can see the daily photographs taken by George Vetter. They should give you some clue as to what the weather was this morning, anyway, as well as a very good overview of our scenic beach in all her moods. (Look through the archives.)<hr><br>Early Tourists<br>In 1805 Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and their exploratory party made camp at Fort Clatsop (up near Warrenton) for the winter. They were here on assignment by President Jefferson to explore his new land purchase and to see what was beyond. It was a particularly wet and miserable winter and they got a nasty case of cabin fever. One day they got some interesting news:<br>'In the Evening some Indians came to our Fort. They informed us by signs, that a large Fish was drove by the Wind & waves on the shore near to where their lodges were, & we all suppose from the description they gave of it, that it must be a Whale.' Joseph Whitehouse, expedition member, December 27, 1805.<br>This whale - or Ecole in the native language - was washed up on what is now known as Cannon Beach. Having nothing better to do and being quite bored, Captain Clark, Sacagawea, and some men decided to go have a look, thus making Cannon Beach the first tourist destination west of the Mississippi River. As you can see, they enjoyed the scenery from Tillamook Head (now within Ecola State Park) and did some beach combing:<br>'... proceeded to the top of the mountain next to the [former?] which is much the highest part and that part faceing the sea is open, from this point I beheld the grandest and most pleasing prospects which my eyes ever surveyed, in my frount a boundless Ocean; ... a most romantic appearance.'<br>'... found only the Skelleton of this Monster (the Whale) on the Sand ... this Skeleton measured 105 feet.' William Clark, January 08, 1806<br>It is interesting to note that a 105 foot whale would have to be a Blue Whale, not the more locally common Gray Whale which tops out at about 45 foot. Since Captain Clark was a professional surveyor, it is reasonable to assume that he measured the 'Skelleton' accurately.<br>Captain Clark ended up purchasing 300 pounds of whale blubber, a souvenir which he much prized. Fortunately, you can now find many excellent restaurants in Cannon Beach serving fresh seafood caught and prepared with care and expertise.",
